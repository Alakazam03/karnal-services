False ceiling and interior work can feel confusing. We've put Karnal rates in one place: cost per sq.ft for POP, gypsum, and common designs. See the numbers first. Then call when you're ready.

## What is false ceiling cost per sq.ft in Karnal?

False ceiling cost in Karnal varies with:

- **Material** – POP (Plaster of Paris) vs gypsum. POP is often cheaper per sq.ft for basic work; gypsum costs more but can be faster to install.
- **Design** – Simple flat vs layered, cove, or pattern. More design means more labour and sometimes more material.
- **Area** – Larger area can mean a slightly lower per sq.ft rate.

Rates are indicative. Get 2–3 quotes from local contractors and ask for labour + material split.

- **POP** – Usually lower per sq.ft for basic false ceiling. Takes more time; finish can be very smooth. Good for custom shapes.
