You don't have to call 10 people to know "kitna lagega." Use a construction cost calculator first. Get a number. Then talk to contractors with confidence.

## Why use a calculator before calling?

- **Same basis** – Area × rate (labour + material) so every quote is comparable.
- **No jargon** – Enter sq.ft and rates; see total and breakdown.
- **Less guesswork** – When you know the range, you can spot a fair quote.

Contractors quote different numbers. A calculator gives you the basis—then you decide who to call.

## Step 1: Know your area

Measure or estimate your built-up area in **sq.ft**. For a new build, use the covered area you plan. For a room or extension, use that area. The calculator multiplies this by the rate.

## Step 2: Get labour and material rates (or use defaults)

Labour and material are often quoted **per sq.ft** in Karnal. You can:

- Use our [default Karnal rates](/service/civil-construction-cost-karnal) in the calculator.
- Or plug in rates from our [rate card](/api/rate-card.pdf) or a quote you already have.

Splitting labour and material helps you see where each contractor is pricing.

## Step 3: Run the calculator

Enter area and (optionally) labour and material per sq.ft. The calculator shows:

- Total estimated cost
- Labour total
- Material total

Use this as a **ballpark**. Real quotes will vary by design, finish, and contractor.

## Step 4: Compare quotes

When contractors quote, ask for a **labour vs material** split if they don't give it. Compare with your calculator result. You're not guessing—you're checking.

## Step 5: Call when you're ready

Use the calculator and rate card first. Then call or WhatsApp when you have a number in mind. No pressure—just clarity. [Try the calculator on our Civil Construction page](/service/civil-construction-cost-karnal).
